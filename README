Version:
========
This is version 0.5.

What are we doing?
==================
In this project, we are aggregating events from our hosts and feed them into a stream processing
language to be manipulated, summarized and actioned.
We will track the state of incoming combination of events and will build checks around them.

What is in this phase?
======================
For POC, we have written few plugins which will analyze and correlate the log messages for
1. Director Bootups
2. Edge bootups 
3. VM attached to edge
4. Process crash and relaunched
5. Director exit
6. Edge exit
7. Edge Reconnect

Nirvana will spit log messages against these evenets like below (taken from running demo)
You will receive messages like below:

I bet that you have noticed the conciseness of log messages. The distributed system
produced a huge number of log messages. Nirvana is nicely summarizing and analyzing
the log messages.

SETUP:
======
Run setup-nirvana.sh script inside nirvana-setup directory.
